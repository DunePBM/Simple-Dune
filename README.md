Simple-Dune
===========

This is a cheap, printable edition of the AH Dune board game.

This is much in the spirit of the wonderful Dirt Cheap Dune, but 
since 2012 there has been a proliferation of really great, clean, 
vector based open source art. Having icons makes the game more 
accessible.

Dune is a wonderful game, but as it has been out of print for 

This file contains all of the materials needed to play, except for 
the rules.

This set features:

* The Game Board (pages 3 to 6)
* Treachery Cards and the Kwisatz Haderach (pages 7 and 8)
* Storm Cards and the Storm Token (page 8)
* Spice Cards (page 9)
* Player Dot Tokens (page 9)
* Spice Tokens (pages 9 and 10)
* Faction Tokens (page 11)
* Leader and Traitor Cards (page 12)
* Player Shields (pages 13 to 18)
* Player Aid (page 19)
* Card Backs Page (page 20)
* An Intentionally Blank Page (page 21)

The different decks (spice, treachery, storm) are different sizes, so 
they can be told apart easily.

I have left options for using regular playing cards on the board. It 
includes a list of all treachery cards and a list of all leaders and 
their values. This gives players the option of only printing some of 
the decks. Also, even if you donâ€™t plan on using playing cards, it 
makes information like leader strength readily available.

Printing options are to either run them on cardstock, or run them on 
regular paper and have them laminated. 

The classiest way to go about this is printing double sided in the 
following order 3, 21, 4, 21, 5, 21, 6, 21, 7, 20, 8, 20, 9, 20, 10, 
20, 11, 21, 12, 20, 13, 19, 14, 19, 15, 19, 16 ,19, 17, 19, 18, 19, 
and then laminating each of the pages.

Thank you for checking this out.
