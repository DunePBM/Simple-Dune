Simple Dune
===========

This is a cheap, printable edition of the AH Dune board game.

Dune is a wonderful game, but it has been out of print for a number of years. There are a number of print-and-play options. This is a low cost option, much in the spirit of the wonderful Dirt Cheap Dune, but since 2012 there has been a proliferation of really great, clean, vector based open source art, and having icons makes the game more accessible.

This file contains all of the materials needed to play, except for the rules.

This set features:

* This introduction and the art  attributions (pages 1 & 2)
* The Game Board (pages 3 to 6)
* Faction Tokens (page 7)
* Spice Tokens (pages 8)
* Miscellaneous Tokens (page 9)
* Leader and Traitor Cards (page 10)
* Treachery, Spice, and Storm Movement Decks – 10 up (pages 11 to 16)
* Treachery, Spice, and Storm Movement Decks – 30 up (pages 17 to 18)
* Player Shields (pages 19 to 24)
* Player Aid (page 25)
* Card Backs Page (page 26)

I have left options for using regular playing cards on the board. It includes a list of all treachery cards and a list of all leaders and their values. This gives players the option of only printing some of the decks. Also, even if you don’t plan on using playing cards, it makes information like leader strength readily available, which can be helpful to players.

Some of the sectors on the Dune board can be kind of small or oddly shaped, and when using printed faction tokens, it can sometimes be hard to tell what territory they are in. So, I have placed a dot on the upper left corner of each token. Whatever territory the dot is over, that is the territory the token is in.

Thank you for checking this out.
